The project titled 'Vilas Store Report 2023' aimed to help the store create an annual sales report , analyze customer behavior, and boost sales. I performed various tasks such as data cleaning, proc0essing, analysis, visualization, and report creation.

The project also answered important questions such as:
How do sales and orders compare using a single chart?
Which month had the highest sales and orders?
Who purchased more, men or women in 2023?
What are the different order statuses in 2023?
Which are the top 5 states contributing to sales?
What is the relation between age and gender based on the number of orders?


Based on the report insights, here are the outcomes of the sales:
Women were more likely to purchase (65%) than men.
Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh were the top contributors to sales (35%).
The adult age group (30-49 yrs) made the most contributions (50%).
Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra channels were the top contributors (80%).

The final conclusion to improve store sales is to target women customers of age group (30-49 yrs) living in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh by showing ads/offers/coupons available on Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra.
